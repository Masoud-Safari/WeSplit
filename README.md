# WeSplit: A Check-Splitting App

## Introduction

This project, WeSplit, is a part of my learning journey through the Hacking with Swift course. It's a simple yet functional app designed to calculate how to split a check among a certain number of people, incorporating options for tip percentage. It served as my introduction to SwiftUI and its approach to building user interfaces.

## Project Description

### What the App Does

- **Functionality:** Users can input the total amount of the check, select how many people the bill will be split between, and choose a tip percentage. The app then calculates the amount each person owes.
- **Technologies Used:** This app was developed using SwiftUI, which allowed for a declarative style of programming and the use of state management to update the UI dynamically.
- **App Demo:**

### Purpose and Learning

- **Objective:** The primary goal was to understand the basics of SwiftUI, including the layout system, data binding, and building reusable views. I chose this project to get a hands-on introduction to developing iOS apps with modern UI components.
- **Challenges and Solutions:** A challenge was understanding how state management works in SwiftUI. I overcame this by creating small, incremental builds to see immediate changes and better understand the data flow within the app.
- **Skills Gained:** Through this project, I became familiar with SwiftUI views, modifiers, and the MVVM architecture pattern. I also gained experience in debugging UI issues in Xcode and leveraging Swiftâ€™s powerful type system for better code safety.

## Acknowledgments

This project was built following the Hacking with Swift tutorial on SwiftUI. I would like to thank [Paul Hudson](https://www.hackingwithswift.com) for creating such a comprehensive and beginner-friendly guide to iOS development.
